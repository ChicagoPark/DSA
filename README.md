## [2] Recursion

> Recursion: A way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.

> Why Recursion?
> * [1] It helps break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use.
> * [2] The prominent usage of recursion in data structures like trees and graphs.
> * [3] It is used in many algorithms (divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic programming).

> When to choose recursion?
> * If we can divine the problem into similar sub problems
> * Design an algorithm to compute n th
> * Write code to list the n ...
> * Implement a method to compute all.
> * Practice

### [2-1] Property of Recursion

> 1. Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
> 2. In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
> 3. `Base condition` is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.

> 1. A method calls itself
> 2. Exit from infinite loop
